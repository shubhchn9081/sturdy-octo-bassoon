Here’s a **complete and detailed game logic breakdown** for a **Stake "Cases" game clone**, including game flow, multiplier mechanics, fairness principles, and UI logic.

This logic is tech-agnostic (can be implemented with **Phaser 3**, **GSAP**, or any frontend framework).

---

## 🎮 GAME NAME: “AI Case Burst” (Clone of Stake’s "Cases")

---

## 🧩 GAME OBJECTIVE

Player places a bet, selects a difficulty, and opens a case to receive a multiplier-based reward. Higher difficulty increases potential reward but reduces chances of a good outcome.

---

## 🔁 FULL GAME FLOW (Step-by-Step)

```
1. Player loads game interface.
2. Inputs bet amount (₹10 - ₹10,000 range).
3. Selects a difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expert.
4. Clicks the “Open Case” button.
5. Game disables inputs and triggers “Opening” animation.
6. Internally, game selects a random multiplier from difficulty pool.
7. Multiplier is revealed with dramatic animation.
8. Payout = Bet Amount × Multiplier.
9. If payout > 0, show confetti or coin animation.
10. Show updated balance and prompt to replay.
```

## 🧮 BACKEND GAME LOGIC (Pure JavaScript Sample)

### 🎚 Difficulty Levels and Their Probability Pools

Each difficulty has:
- A fixed array of possible multipliers.
- A probability weight distribution.

```js
const multiplierPools = {
  easy: [
    { multiplier: 0.1, weight: 20 },
    { multiplier: 0.2, weight: 20 },
    { multiplier: 0.5, weight: 20 },
    { multiplier: 1, weight: 15 },
    { multiplier: 1.5, weight: 10 },
    { multiplier: 2, weight: 5 },
    { multiplier: 5, weight: 4 },
    { multiplier: 10, weight: 3 },
    { multiplier: 15, weight: 2 },
    { multiplier: 23, weight: 1 }
  ],
  medium: [
    { multiplier: 0, weight: 30 },
    { multiplier: 0.2, weight: 15 },
    { multiplier: 0.5, weight: 15 },
    { multiplier: 1, weight: 10 },
    { multiplier: 3, weight: 10 },
    { multiplier: 5, weight: 6 },
    { multiplier: 10, weight: 5 },
    { multiplier: 25, weight: 5 },
    { multiplier: 50, weight: 3 },
    { multiplier: 115, weight: 1 }
  ],
  hard: [
    { multiplier: 0, weight: 50 },
    { multiplier: 0.5, weight: 15 },
    { multiplier: 2, weight: 10 },
    { multiplier: 5, weight: 8 },
    { multiplier: 10, weight: 6 },
    { multiplier: 50, weight: 5 },
    { multiplier: 100, weight: 4 },
    { multiplier: 500, weight: 1 },
    { multiplier: 1000, weight: 1 }
  ],
  expert: [
    { multiplier: 0, weight: 60 },
    { multiplier: 1, weight: 10 },
    { multiplier: 10, weight: 8 },
    { multiplier: 50, weight: 6 },
    { multiplier: 100, weight: 5 },
    { multiplier: 500, weight: 5 },
    { multiplier: 2000, weight: 3 },
    { multiplier: 10000, weight: 1 }
  ]
};
```

---

### 🎲 Weighted Random Multiplier Selector

```js
function getRandomMultiplier(difficulty) {
  const pool = multiplierPools[difficulty];
  const totalWeight = pool.reduce((sum, m) => sum + m.weight, 0);
  const rand = Math.random() * totalWeight;
  let runningWeight = 0;
  
  for (let entry of pool) {
    runningWeight += entry.weight;
    if (rand <= runningWeight) {
      return entry.multiplier;
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 💰 Final Game Calculation

```js
function playCaseGame(betAmount, difficulty) {
  const multiplier = getRandomMultiplier(difficulty);
  const winAmount = +(betAmount * multiplier).toFixed(2);

  return {
    multiplier,
    winAmount,
    isWin: winAmount > 0
  };
}
```

---

## 💡 UI INTERACTION LOGIC

### Input Validation
- If bet is empty, invalid, or below ₹10, show error
- Highlight selected difficulty
- Disable "Open Case" button during animation

### Animation Logic (GSAP or Phaser)
- Case wiggles ➝ lifts open ➝ reward floats upward
- Coin trail or burst appears if multiplier > 1
- Result box animates into view (scale, bounce)

---

## 🔐 Provably Fair Concept (Optional for Transparency)
Generate:
- Client seed
- Server seed (hashed till after reveal)
- Nonce

Use:
```js
multiplier = getMultiplierFromHash(serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce)
```

This is optional but adds trust if you aim to scale the game.

---

## 🧾 Outcome Display Example

**Case Opened!**
- 🔥 Multiplier: 15x
- 💰 You Win: ₹1500

Button: “Play Again” | “Change Bet”

---

## 📈 RTP & House Edge

Design the probability weights so average return is ~98% (like Stake).
Total return = sum of (multiplier * weight%) for each difficulty.

Would you like me to now:
1. Generate working **Phaser 3** or **GSAP** code using this logic?
2. Add a **simple UI with slider, animation, and coin visuals**?
3. Create a Replit template or share folder structure?
