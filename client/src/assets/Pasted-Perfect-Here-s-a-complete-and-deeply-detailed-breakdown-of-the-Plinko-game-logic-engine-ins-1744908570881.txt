Perfect. Here's a **complete and deeply detailed breakdown** of the **Plinko game logic engine** inspired by Stake’s version – including **ball drop physics, probabilities, multiplier logic, animations, and backend fairness**.

## 🎯 **Plinko Game Logic Engine (Like Stake)**

---

### 🎮 GAME OVERVIEW

- A ball is dropped from the top of a triangular peg board.
- It bounces left/right at each level until it reaches the bottom.
- The final slot determines the multiplier.
- More risk = higher possible multipliers but lower chances of big hits.

---

## 🧠 BACKEND LOGIC (PROVABLY FAIR)

### ✅ Core Parameters
```js
const ROWS = 16; // Total levels in Stake Plinko
const PATHS = 17; // Total slots at the bottom = ROWS + 1
```

---

### 🎲 Step 1: Generate Ball Path
```js
function dropBall(seed, riskLevel) {
  let path = [];
  let currentPosition = Math.floor(PATHS / 2); // start at center

  for (let i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) {
    const direction = pseudoRandom(seed + i) > 0.5 ? 1 : -1;
    currentPosition += direction;
    currentPosition = Math.max(0, Math.min(PATHS - 1, currentPosition));
    path.push(currentPosition);
  }

  return {
    finalSlot: currentPosition,
    path,
  };
}
```

> 🔐 `pseudoRandom(seed)` can be implemented using HMAC-SHA256 or provably fair systems for transparency. On Stake, they use a hashed combination of client seed, server seed, and nonce.

---

### 🎰 Step 2: Multiplier Table
Each **risk level** has a different multiplier range. Below is an **example table (approximate Stake values):**

```js
const multipliers = {
  low:    [1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 5.5, 9, 14, 9, 5.5, 3.5, 2, 1.5, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1],
  medium: [0.5, 0.7, 1.2, 2, 3.5, 5, 9, 14, 24, 14, 9, 5, 3.5, 2, 1.2, 0.7, 0.5],
  high:   [0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2, 4, 8, 17, 29, 17, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.2],
};
```

---

### 💸 Step 3: Calculate Winnings
```js
function calculatePayout(betAmount, finalSlot, riskLevel) {
  const multiplier = multipliers[riskLevel][finalSlot];
  return +(betAmount * multiplier).toFixed(8);
}
```

---

## 🧩 ANIMATION + VISUAL LOGIC (Frontend / Canvas)

### 📍 1. Peg Board Structure

```txt
Visual Representation:

          ●
        ●   ●
      ●   ●   ●
    ●   ●   ●   ●
  ... (up to 16 rows)
```

- Each level has pegs horizontally aligned and offset from the previous level.
- The ball hits a peg and decides to go left/right with 50% probability.

---

### 🟠 2. Ball Physics & Movement

#### Drop Animation Logic:
- Use a canvas or HTML/CSS with JS animation.
- Animate the ball from top to bottom using timed intervals.
- Each level, animate the ball bouncing slightly off the peg before moving diagonally.

#### Example Ball Movement (pseudo-code):
```js
function animateDrop(path) {
  for (let i = 0; i < path.length; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      moveBallTo(path[i], i); // column, row
    }, i * 150); // delay per row
  }
}
```

#### `moveBallTo(col, row)`:
- Uses CSS `transform: translate(Xpx, Ypx)` or canvas `drawCircle(x, y)`
- Apply small easing/elastic bounce for realism

#### Sounds (optional):
- Play “bounce” SFX each time it hits a peg.
- Final “ding” when it reaches the bottom.

---

## 🔁 GAME FLOW SUMMARY

1. **User selects:**
   - Bet amount
   - Risk level (Low, Medium, High)
   - Number of rows (optional)
2. **Ball drops** through pegboard (16 rows).
3. At each row, **50/50 left or right decision**.
4. Final slot → **multiplier from table**
5. **Winnings = bet × multiplier**
6. Animate win multiplier and allow retry

---

## 🛡️ Admin Side (Backend Controls)

- Provably fair system should publish:
  - Client seed
  - Server seed hash
  - Nonce
- Admins may adjust:
  - Multiplier odds (slightly)
  - Risk category definitions
  - Minimum RTP per session
- Can use blockchain hashes or HMAC verification for transparency

---

## 🧪 Example Simulation Code

```js
let game = dropBall("user123-seed-456", "high");
console.log("Path:", game.path);
console.log("Final Slot:", game.finalSlot);
console.log("Payout:", calculatePayout(0.001, game.finalSlot, "high"));
```
