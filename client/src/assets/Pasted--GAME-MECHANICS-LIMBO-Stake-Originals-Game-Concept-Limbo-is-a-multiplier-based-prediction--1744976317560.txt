🎮 GAME MECHANICS – LIMBO (Stake Originals)
🔁 Game Concept:
Limbo is a multiplier-based prediction game.

The player sets a target multiplier (e.g., 2.00x).

The game then randomly generates a multiplier (e.g., 1.08x, 1.00x, 2.89x).

If the generated multiplier is equal to or higher than the player’s target, the player wins.

If it's less than the target, the player loses.

💸 House Edge:
Designed to have a house edge of around 1%.

The lower your target multiplier, the higher your chance of winning, and vice versa.

🎯 Game Result Logic:
Uses a provably fair algorithm to generate multipliers.

The outcomes are cryptographically hashed and verifiable under “Fairness” (bottom right button).

🧠 UI FEATURES EXPLAINED
🎯 Main Interface
Large multiplier display in the center (e.g., 1.08x, 1.00x, 2.89x) shows the result of the latest round.

🔢 Multiplier History
Above the result, recent multiplier outcomes are shown in horizontal capsules (e.g., 1.25x, 2.89x, etc.).
