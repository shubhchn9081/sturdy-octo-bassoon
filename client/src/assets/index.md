The integration enables the following payment methods:

- UPI Fast Transfer

- UPI App
- UPI Fast QR

## APay Credentials (Same for Both Projects)

The following credentials are already set up and can be used directly:

- API Key: `d6a870ecdd68ed30951e601442d620ca`
- Project ID: `9440140`
- Webhook ID: `6898076`
- Webhook Access Key: `e6f1ac0ea5d105be8fc0b044744b36d3`
- Webhook Private Key: `f3769c2fb80ac01c36ddd589a0fd9279`

## Security Note

While using the same credentials is convenient, it's important to:

1. Store these credentials in environment variables, not in code
2. Use proper error handling and logging
3. Implement transaction idempotency to prevent duplicate processing
4. Verify webhook signatures to ensure callback authenticity
