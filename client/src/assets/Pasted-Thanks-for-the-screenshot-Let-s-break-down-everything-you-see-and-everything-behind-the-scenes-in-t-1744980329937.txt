Thanks for the screenshot! Let’s break down everything you see and everything behind-the-scenes in this **Wheel game on Stake**, based on this exact interface and gameplay:

## 🎡 WHEEL GAME (Stake Originals) – Full Breakdown

---

### 🔍 GAME OBJECTIVE

The player places a bet and the wheel spins. If the pointer lands on a segment with the multiplier you selected, you win that multiplier times your bet.

---

## 🧠 GAME MECHANICS

### 🎯 Segment Structure (Visual)

- The wheel is divided into **segments** — here, you selected **30 segments**.
- Each segment is **color-coded**, representing a **specific multiplier**.
- Multiplier values shown in your interface:
  - **0.00x** (Loss)
  - **1.50x**
  - **1.70x**
  - **2.00x**
  - **3.00x**
  - **4.00x**

#### Example:
From the image, it looks like the following **color-multiplier mapping** might exist (approximated):
- 🟨 Yellow – 2.00x  
- 🟩 Green – 1.50x  
- 🟧 Orange – 4.00x  
- 🟪 Purple – 3.00x  
- ⚪ White – 1.70x  
- 🔵 Blue/Dark – 0.00x (Lose)

The **pointer on top** shows the result after spin ends.

### 🧮 Game Result & Logic

#### RNG-based Spin (Backend):
```python
import random

segments = [
    {"multiplier": 0.0, "count": 18},  # 60% lose segments
    {"multiplier": 1.5, "count": 6},   # 20%
    {"multiplier": 1.7, "count": 2},   # 6.67%
    {"multiplier": 2.0, "count": 2},   # 6.67%
    {"multiplier": 3.0, "count": 1},   # 3.33%
    {"multiplier": 4.0, "count": 1},   # 3.33%
]

# Build wheel
wheel = []
for segment in segments:
    wheel += [segment["multiplier"]] * segment["count"]

# Spin result
result = random.choice(wheel)
```

#### 🧾 Winnings:
```python
if result == user_selected_multiplier:
    winnings = bet_amount * result
else:
    winnings = 0
```

Note: This version seems to **not require a specific multiplier bet**, but just spins and pays based on the landed segment. The multiplier payout is determined by the result, **not a user prediction** like Limbo or Dice.

## 🎛️ UI COMPONENTS EXPLAINED

| Element | Function |
|--------|----------|
| 🎯 **Manual/Auto** | Choose between single bet or auto-betting |
| 💰 **Bet Amount** | Enter Bitcoin value to wager |
| ⚙️ **Risk Selector** | Changes distribution of segments on the wheel:  
  - **Low Risk:** More low multipliers, fewer 0.00x  
  - **Medium Risk:** Balanced  
  - **High Risk:** More 0.00x, fewer high multipliers |
| 🧩 **Segment Count** | Changes how many segments the wheel has (15, 30, 60...) |
| ✅ **Bet Button** | Triggers spin animation and game round |
| 🔄 **Animated Wheel** | Spins and lands on a multiplier segment |
| 📊 **Result History** | Below the wheel, displays recent results (green = win) |
| 🔐 **Fairness Button** | At bottom-right, opens provably fair seed & verification logic |

---

### ⚙️ Animation (Frontend Logic)

- Uses easing curve (e.g., easeOutQuad) to slow wheel as it stops.
- Final **segment index** determines where it stops, and result is visually mapped based on segment angles.
- Sounds/vibration triggered on:
  - Spin start
  - Segment hover during spin
  - Spin result landing

---

## 🧠 ADVANCED LOGIC VARIATIONS

You can dynamically change:
- The **number of segments**
- The **payout distribution**
- **Visual themes** per risk level
- Add a **jackpot chance** in rare segments (e.g., 100x)

## 🛠️ ADMIN PANEL FUNCTIONS (Backoffice)

| Control | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Segment Configuration | Define number of segments and multiplier mapping |
| RTP Setting | Set return-to-player for house edge (usually 98% or 96%) |
| Fairness Seed Controls | Configure public/private seeds |
| Max Bet & Min Bet | For controlling user exposure |
| Risk Profile Logic | Define % allocation of winning/losing segments |
| Jackpot Frequency | Inject rare segments dynamically (for high payout excitement) |

## ✅ SUMMARY

| Category | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| 🎮 Game Type | Multiplier-based spin |
| 🧠 RNG | Segment-based random draw |
| 🎨 UI | Color-coded segments, spin animation, payout bar |
| 💰 Payout | Based on landed multiplier |
| 🧪 Fairness | Seed-based verifiable randomness |
| ⚙️ Flexibility | Segment control, auto mode, risk tuning |

If you'd like, I can:
- Build this exact game logic in **React + Canvas**
- Provide backend code (Node.js or Python) for RNG
- Generate a complete **Replit or Firebase** version with wallet integration
- Help you create a “Skin” version of this for your own brand

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
