Here’s an in-depth breakdown of the **game logic, UI components, and admin-side mechanics** for two major games: **Wheel** and **Keno** – as seen on Stake and similar platforms. These will help you fully replicate or customize them for your own platform.

## 🎡 WHEEL GAME – DETAILED GAME LOGIC

### 🔍 Game Objective
The player bets on a specific color or segment on a spinning wheel. If the pointer stops on their chosen segment, they win based on predefined multipliers.

---

### 🧠 GAME LOGIC

#### 🎯 Wheel Design
- The wheel is split into **N segments**, each with:
  - A **color**
  - A **multiplier** (e.g. 2x, 3x, 5x, 50x)
- Example (typical Stake-style wheel):
  - 49 Blue segments = 2x
  - 49 Green segments = 3x
  - 1 Red segment = 50x

#### 🧮 Probability Logic
```python
wheel_segments = [
    {"color": "blue", "multiplier": 2, "count": 49},
    {"color": "green", "multiplier": 3, "count": 49},
    {"color": "red", "multiplier": 50, "count": 1},
]

wheel = []
for segment in wheel_segments:
    wheel += [segment] * segment["count"]

result = random.choice(wheel)
```

#### 💥 Payout Logic
```python
if user_selected_color == result["color"]:
    winnings = bet_amount * result["multiplier"]
else:
    winnings = 0
```

#### ⚙️ Animation Mechanics
- Spin animation uses easing functions (ease-in-out) and can include 2–4 full wheel rotations before slowing down.
- Use a canvas or SVG for pointer and segment rotation.
- Final resting angle should correspond to the winning segment index.

## 🎲 KENO GAME – DETAILED GAME LOGIC

### 🔍 Game Objective
The player selects 1–10 (or more) numbers from a grid (typically 1–40 or 1–80). The system draws 10–20 numbers randomly. Winnings depend on how many of the player's numbers match the drawn ones.

---

### 🧠 GAME LOGIC

#### ⚙️ Keno Rules

- Grid: 1 to 40 (or 80)
- Player picks: 1–10 numbers
- System draws: 10–20 random numbers
- Match = Win based on a **payout table**

#### 🎰 Random Number Draw
```python
import random

player_picks = [5, 12, 19, 27, 33, 38]
drawn_numbers = random.sample(range(1, 41), 10)

matches = set(player_picks) & set(drawn_numbers)
number_of_hits = len(matches)
```

#### 💵 Payout Table Example (for 6 picks)

| Matches | Payout (multiplier) |
|---------|---------------------|
| 0       | 0x |
| 1       | 0x |
| 2       | 0.5x |
| 3       | 1.5x |
| 4       | 3x |
| 5       | 10x |
| 6       | 100x |

```python
payout_multiplier = get_multiplier(len(player_picks), number_of_hits)
winnings = bet_amount * payout_multiplier
```

#### 🔐 Provably Fair Logic
- Hash-based RNG where client & server seed are used to generate drawn numbers.
- Displayed under “Fairness” tab with ability to verify outcome.

### 🧾 UI ELEMENTS

| Component | Function |
|----------|----------|
| Keno Grid | Number buttons 1–40 |
| Selected Numbers | Highlights chosen picks |
| Drawn Balls | Visual animation of result numbers |
| Match Highlights | Shows correct picks with animation |
| Bet Panel | Amount input and payout preview |
| Auto Pick | Randomly pick numbers |
| Autobet | Continuous play settings |
| History | Displays previous games with result and profit/loss |

---

### 🔐 Admin Controls

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Payout Table | Dynamic multiplier editing |
| RNG Engine | Seed-based or server RNG switch |
| Max Picks | Limit number of picks allowed |
| Result Delay | Add animation time for better UX |

---

## ⚠️ BONUS: Visual & UX Tips

- Add glow/highlight effects for selected and matched numbers.
- Use bouncy animations on number reveal.
- Include jackpot or bonus round probability.
- Display RTP % in info modal.
- Gamify with achievements (e.g., "Matched 10/10!" = badge)
