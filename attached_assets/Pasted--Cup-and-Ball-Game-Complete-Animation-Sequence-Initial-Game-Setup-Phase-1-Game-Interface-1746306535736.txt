# Cup and Ball Game: Complete Animation Sequence

## Initial Game Setup Phase

### 1. Game Interface Initialization (0-500ms)
- **Visual:** Game container fades in (opacity 0 → 1 over 300ms)
- **Elements:** Three cups appear in starting positions using a subtle bounce effect
  - Each cup scales from 0.9 → 1.0 with a spring easing function
  - Cups are arranged horizontally with equal spacing (e.g., at positions 25%, 50%, and 75% of container width)
- **Technical:** Position cup elements in the DOM with absolute positioning or CSS grid/flexbox
- **State:** Game initializes in "waiting for bet" state

### 2. Controls Animation (500-800ms)

- **Elements:**
  - Difficulty selector appears with radio buttons or segmented control
  - Bet amount input field with increment/decrement buttons
  - "Potential profit" display initially showing $0.00
  - Start button (initially disabled)
- **Technical:** Enable event listeners for control interactions
- **State:** No bet placed yet, game awaiting player input

### 3. Bet Placement Animation (User-dependent timing)
- **Visual:** 
  - Input fields highlight subtly on focus
  - Numbers increment/decrement with subtle scaling animations
- **Elements:**
  - Bet amount updates with each input change
  - Potential profit calculation updates in real-time

- **State:** Game ready to start once bet is confirmed

## Game Initialization Animation

### 4. Game Start Transition (0-800ms after Start button press)
- **Visual:** 
  - Controls panel slides down and minimizes (transform: translateY(0) → translateY(80%))
  - "Get Ready" text briefly appears with fade-in/fade-out
  - Camera perspective subtly shifts to focus on cups (if using 3D perspective)
- **Elements:**
  - Start button changes to "Playing..." state
  - Controls become disabled with reduced opacity
- **Technical:** Transition game state to "initializing" and lock controls
- **State:** Game preparing to show ball placement

### 5. Ball Introduction Animation (800-2000ms)
- **Visual:** 
  - Small white ball fades in (opacity 0 → 1 over 300ms)
  - Ball performs a subtle bouncing animation
- **Elements:**
  - Ball appears above the play area
  - Subtle spotlight effect focuses on the ball
- **Technical:** Create ball element and position it using absolute positioning
- **State:** Ball visible but not yet placed under cup

### 6. Initial Ball Placement Animation (2000-3500ms)
- **Visual:**
  - Ball moves with a slight arc trajectory toward randomly selected cup
  - Selected cup subtly raises (transform: translateY(0) → translateY(-20px) over 400ms)
  - Ball slides under the raised cup
  - Cup lowers back to original position (transform: translateY(-20px) → translateY(0) over 400ms)
- **Elements:**
  - Subtle directional light creates shadow under raised cup
  - Ball disappears once under cup (opacity 1 → 0)
- **Technical:**
  - Use `requestAnimationFrame` or CSS animations for smooth movement
  - Randomly select cup index (0, 1, or 2) for ball placement
  - Store ball position in game state but hide from player
- **State:** Ball now hidden under one cup, ready for shuffling

## Shuffling Sequence Animation

### 7. Pre-Shuffle Anticipation (3500-4000ms)
- **Visual:**
  - Brief pause (500ms) to build anticipation
  - Subtle camera zoom effect (if using 3D perspective)
  - "Shuffling begins..." text briefly appears
- **Elements:**
  - Cups subtly pulsate (scale 1.0 → 1.03 → 1.0)
  - Background darkens slightly to focus attention on cups
- **Technical:** Prepare shuffle sequence based on difficulty
  - Easy: Generate 5 random cup swaps
  - Medium: Generate 10 random cup swaps
  - Hard: Generate 15 random cup swaps
- **State:** Game ready to begin shuffling animation

### 8. Cup Shuffling Animation (4000ms-Variable duration based on difficulty)
- **Visual:** Cups swap positions in sequence with smooth animations
  - **For each swap in sequence:**
    1. Two cups simultaneously rise slightly (transform: translateY(0) → translateY(-15px) over 150ms)
    2. Cups move horizontally to swap positions (transform: translateX() with cubic-bezier easing over 250-350ms)
    3. Cups lower back to original vertical position (transform: translateY(-15px) → translateY(0) over 150ms)
    4. Brief pause between swaps (50-200ms varying by difficulty)
  
- **Elements:**
  - Subtle motion blur effect during fast movements
  - Shadow follows each cup during movement
  - Optional trace lines showing movement path

- **Technical:**
  - **Animation timing:**
    - Easy: ~550ms per swap (5 swaps ≈ 2.75s total)
    - Medium: ~450ms per swap (10 swaps ≈ 4.5s total)
    - Hard: ~350ms per swap (15 swaps ≈ 5.25s total)
  - Track updated position of the ball during each swap
  - Use CSS transforms with hardware acceleration
  - Apply z-index changes to maintain proper stacking order

- **Ball tracking logic:**
  - If cup with ball is involved in swap, update ball position in game state
  - Example: If ball is under cup 0 and cups 0 and 2 swap, ball is now under cup 2

- **State:** Cups continuously moving until shuffle sequence complete

### 9. Shuffle Slowdown Animation (Variable end time)
- **Visual:**
  - Final 2-3 swaps gradually slow down (increasing duration by ~50ms each)
  - Last swap has more pronounced movement
- **Elements:**
  - Motion blur effect reduces as speed decreases
- **Technical:** Gradually increase the timing parameter for each animation
- **State:** Shuffling completing, preparing for selection phase

### 10. Post-Shuffle Settlement (End of shuffling + 500ms)
- **Visual:**
  - All cups perform a subtle "settling" animation (slight bounce)
  - Cups spread out slightly for easier selection
- **Elements:**
  - "Select a cup" text appears with fade-in
  - Cups gain a subtle highlight or glow effect to indicate they're selectable
- **Technical:** Enable cup click/touch event listeners
- **State:** Game awaiting player selection

## Selection and Reveal Phase

### 11. Cup Selection Animation (User-dependent timing)
- **Visual:** 
  - Cups highlight on hover/touch with a subtle glow effect
  - Selected cup performs a slight "press" animation (scale 1.0 → 0.95 → 1.0 over 300ms)
- **Elements:**
  - Non-selected cups dim slightly
  - "Selected" indicator appears above chosen cup
- **Technical:**

- **Visual:**
  - Brief pause (800ms) to build anticipation
  - Subtle camera focus effect on selected cup
- **Elements:**
  - "Revealing..." text briefly appears
  - Loading spinner or pulsing animation indicates processing
- **Technical:** During this time, the server processes the bet and determines outcome
- **State:** Game preparing for result reveal

### 13. Sequential Cup Reveal Animation (1000-3000ms after selection)
- **Visual:** Cups lift one by one to reveal contents
  - **For each cup (in specific order):**
    1. Cup rises with slight rotation (transform: translateY(0) → translateY(-60px) rotate(10deg) over 500ms)
    2. Cup hovers in raised position briefly (300ms)
    3. If last cup or contains ball, remains raised; otherwise slowly lowers back
  
- **Elements:**
  - Ball becomes visible under the cup that contains it
  - Ball performs subtle spinning animation when revealed
  - If ball is under selected cup, ball glows or sparkles

- **Technical:**
  - **Reveal order:**
    1. First reveal a non-selected cup without the ball
    2. If another non-selected cup exists without the ball, reveal it next
    3. Finally reveal either the selected cup or the last remaining cup
  - This creates maximum anticipation regardless of outcome

- **State:** Game revealing result to player

### 14. Win/Loss Result Animation (3000-4500ms after selection)
- **Visual:**
  - **Win scenario:** 
    - Ball under selected cup pulses with golden glow

  - Controls panel slides back up to full size
  - "Play Again" button appears with pulse animation
- **Elements:**
  - Updated balance displayed
  - Bet amount field reset to previous amount or minimum
- **Technical:** Reset game state for new round
- **State:** Game ready for new bet

## Special Animation Effects

### Difficulty-Specific Visual Effects
- **Easy difficulty:**
  - Slower, more deliberate cup movements
  - More exaggerated arcs during swaps
  - Longer pauses between swaps
  - Cup paths more predictable

- **Medium difficulty:**
  - Moderate speed movements
  - Standard arc heights
  - Occasional changes in swap speed to create rhythm variation
  - Some quick double-swaps (same cup moves twice in sequence)

- **Hard difficulty:**
  - Faster overall movements
  - Lower, more subtle arcs that are harder to track
  - Variable swap speeds (some very quick)
  - Occasional "fake" moves (cup rises slightly but doesn't swap)
  - More complex swap patterns (e.g., sequential swaps involving the same cup)

### Mobile-Specific Adaptations
- **Touch targets:** Cups spaced further apart on mobile screens
- **Visual feedback:** More pronounced selection state for touch accuracy
- **Layout:** Controls positioned for thumb accessibility
- **Performance:** Simplified animations for lower-powered devices

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Reduced motion mode:** Option to simplify animations for users with motion sensitivity
- **High contrast mode:** Enhanced visual differences between cups and ball
- **Timing adjustments:** Option to slow down animations for better tracking
- **Audio cues:** Sound effects synchronized with animations for audio feedback

## Technical Animation Implementation Details

### CSS Animation Properties
- **Transform functions used:**
  - `translateX/Y` for position changes (hardware accelerated)
  - `scale` for size changes
  - `rotate` for cup lifting effect
  - `perspective` for 3D-like effects

- **Timing functions:**
  - `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` for natural bouncy effects
  - `ease-out` for settling movements
  - `linear` for consistent speed sections

- **Animation optimizations:**
  - `will-change` property for cups that will animate
  - Composite properties (transform, opacity) for performance
  - requestAnimationFrame for JS animations

### State Transition Triggers
- Each animation phase tied to specific game state changes
- State machine pattern ensures animations occur in proper sequence
- Animation promises allow for proper sequencing and timing

### Performance Considerations
- Batch DOM updates to prevent layout thrashing
- Use opacity and transform for most animations (avoid animating layout properties)
- Implement frame rate throttling for lower-end devices
- Preload and cache animation assets
